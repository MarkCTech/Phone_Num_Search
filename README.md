# Phone_Num_Search 
## Summary
This was an exercise in using Regular Expressions and the OS package in Python.  

The original goal was to open a zipped folder, then search through the many subfolders and their text files for a USA format phone number (XXX-XXX-XXX).  
I first achieved this with detatched procedures which I had to feed the full file path, then reformatted the search into it's own function and later added a function to unzip any zipped file in the working directory and search through any .txt files found therein.
 
 ## Using the program
 Place any .txt files to be searched in the 'zip_files/' directory, and run the .py in your IDE
